# ============================================================
# FiestaBoard Unified Dockerfile
# Combines API (Python/FastAPI) and UI (React Router v7 / Vite SPA)
# in one image. nginx serves the static UI bundle directly — no Node
# runtime process in production.
# ============================================================

# --- Stage 1: Build Python dependencies ---
FROM python:3.14-slim AS python-builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install build dependencies for compiling Python packages with C extensions
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir fastapi uvicorn[standard] supervisor

# --- Stage 2: Build the React Router v7 UI (static SPA) ---
FROM node:26-alpine AS ui-builder

ARG VERSION=dev

WORKDIR /app

# Build deps for native modules (lightningcss, swc, sharp if any)
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++

# Install web dependencies. We use `npm install` (not `npm ci`) because
# this migration PR drops the Next.js-pinned package-lock.json — the
# first successful build in CI will produce a fresh lockfile that can
# be committed in a follow-up to restore reproducible `npm ci` builds.
# The lockfile is COPYed conditionally so the build works whether or
# not it has been committed yet.
COPY web/package.json ./
COPY web/package-lock.json* ./

# @fiestaboard/ui is published to registry.npmjs.org and installs
# anonymously — no token, no .npmrc, no BuildKit secret.

        npm ci --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit; \

    fi

# Copy source files (everything Vite + RR7 needs to build)

# Static SPA build. Output lands in /app/build/client/ (RR7 framework
# mode with `ssr: false`). Cache the Vite build cache so local
# rebuilds are faster; CI doesn't benefit (fresh runner each job).
ENV NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/app/node_modules/.vite \

# --- Stage 3: Shared runtime base (API + static UI + nginx) ---
# This stage holds everything common to production and dev. The concrete
# `runtime` (production) and `runtime-dev` stages below both build FROM it.

# Install nginx, wget, git, and gosu. Node.js is no longer installed
# in the production runtime — the UI is a static Vite bundle that
# nginx serves directly. Dropping nodejs shrinks the runtime image
# by ~150MB.
# git is required for the external plugin install/update system.
# network-manager (nmcli + nm-online) is used by FiestaPi WiFi-management
# endpoints. Harmless on non-Pi deployments.

# compiles every module in src/ and plugins/. Measured on this tree:

# start and every reboot, scaling with CPU on a Pi.

# The Vite/React-Router dev server needs Node at runtime; production
# doesn't (nginx serves the static SPA). Split that into a separate
# target so the prod image keeps the ~150MB Node savings while
# docker-compose.dev.yml can opt in with `target: runtime-dev`.
#
# This stage is deliberately placed BEFORE the production `runtime` stage
# so that `runtime` remains the Dockerfile's LAST stage. A `docker build`
# without an explicit `--target` builds the last stage; keeping production
# last means the published image (and any target-less build) boots
# supervisord.conf, not supervisord-dev.conf. See issue #1377.

# builds that omit `--target` land on production (api + nginx via
# supervisord.conf) rather than the dev stage above. See issue #1377.
