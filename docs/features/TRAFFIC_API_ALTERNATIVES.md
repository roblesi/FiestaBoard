## Migration Guide

### Switching from Google to HERE

The system is already configured to use HERE as the primary provider with Google as fallback.

**Steps:**
1. Get a free HERE API key (see setup above)
2. Update your configuration:
   ```bash
   HERE_API_KEY=your_here_api_key
   TRAFFIC_API_PROVIDER=here
   TRAFFIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true
   ```
3. Restart the service
4. Monitor logs to ensure HERE is working
5. Keep Google key as fallback for reliability

**Expected Results:**
- 100% cost reduction (within free tier)
- Same traffic quality
- Automatic fallback to Google if HERE fails

### Testing Different Providers

To test a different provider:

1. Set `TRAFFIC_API_PROVIDER=google` to test Google
2. Set `TRAFFIC_API_PROVIDER=here` to test HERE
3. Monitor logs for API calls and cache hits
4. Compare traffic times for accuracy

## Monitoring API Usage

### Check Cache Statistics

The system logs cache performance:
- Cache hits vs misses
- API calls made
- Hit rate percentage

Look for log messages like:
```
Cache HIT: here_DRIVE_abc123 (age: 120s)
Cache MISS: here_DRIVE_xyz789
```

### HERE API Dashboard

Monitor usage at: https://platform.here.com/admin/apps

### Google Cloud Console

Monitor usage at: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard

## Best Practices

1. **Enable Caching** (default: enabled)
   - Reduces API calls by 83-92%
   - Set `TRAFFIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true`

2. **Adjust Cache TTL** based on needs:
   - 300s (5 min) - Good balance (default)
   - 600s (10 min) - More savings, slightly stale data
   - 180s (3 min) - Fresher data, more API calls

3. **Use HERE as Primary**
   - Free tier covers most use cases
   - Keep Google as fallback for reliability

4. **Monitor Rate Limits**
   - System warns at 80% of hourly limit
   - Blocks requests at 100% to prevent overages

5. **Set Appropriate Refresh Intervals**
   - 300s (5 min) recommended for traffic pages
   - Longer intervals for less time-sensitive routes

## Troubleshooting

### HERE API Not Working

Check logs for errors:
- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid API key
- `403 Forbidden` - API key lacks permissions
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid location format

System automatically falls back to Google if HERE fails.

### High API Costs

1. Verify caching is enabled: `TRAFFIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true`
2. Check cache hit rate in logs
3. Increase cache TTL if acceptable
4. Ensure you're using HERE (free tier)
5. Review page refresh intervals

### Traffic Data Inaccurate

1. Compare HERE vs Google results
2. Check time of day (traffic varies)
3. Verify location format (address vs lat,lng)
4. Ensure travel mode is correct
