"""The image must ship precompiled bytecode (issue #1950).

``.dockerignore`` excludes ``__pycache__/``, so nothing the build copies in
carries bytecode. Without an explicit ``compileall`` the first import in a
fresh container — the one uvicorn performs at boot — compiles every module
under ``src/`` and ``plugins/`` before the API answers anything. Measured on
this tree: **529 ms cold vs 331 ms warm**, ~198 ms (37%) of first-import
cost paid again on every container start and every reboot, and more than
that on a Pi.

This pins the RELATIONSHIP, not a line number: as long as ``__pycache__``
is excluded from the build context, the Dockerfile has to compile the
sources it copies. Deleting either half alone fails here.
