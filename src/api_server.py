# Create FastAPI app

# that works. Keep it short and keep it true — no endpoint that does not exist.
API_DESCRIPTION = """\
FiestaBoard drives one or more split-flap displays from templated pages.

### Hello world

Put text on the board right now:

```bash
curl -X POST http://fiestaboard.local:4420/api/v1/boards/primary/message \\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  -d '{"text": "HELLO WORLD"}'
```

`primary` works as a board id on every `/v1/boards/...` path, so a
single-board install never has to look one up — and a multi-board install
puts the id there instead.

### How the pieces fit

Four nouns, and one way to do each thing:

* A **board** is a physical display. `POST /v1/boards/{board}/message` writes
  to it; `GET /v1/boards/{board}` says what is on it and why.
* A **page** is a template: literal text plus `{{plugin_id.variable}}`
  placeholders that **plugins** fill with live data.
* A **schedule** (or a **collection**) decides which page a board shows at a
  given moment. A message write bypasses both for a one-off; `DELETE
  /v1/boards/{board}/message` hands the board back to the schedule.

### Base URL

nginx fronts the API under `/api`, so every path below is reached as
`/api/<path>` — `GET /v1/status` is
`http://fiestaboard.local:4420/api/v1/status`. These docs live at
`/api/docs`, the schema at `/api/openapi.json`.

### What is not here

This document is the API to build against: 33 operations. The app serves
~200 more, but they are the web UI's private RPC channel — undocumented on
purpose, with no compatibility promise, and liable to change in any release.
They are published separately at `/api/internal/openapi.json` for the UI's
own contract checks. Two flat legacy operations, `POST /send-message` and
`POST /refresh`, remain here because earlier documentation named them; both
are deprecated and both name their `/v1` replacement in a `Link` header.

### Authentication

Off by default: a fresh install answers every request. With
`FIESTABOARD_AUTH_ENABLED=true`, a script sends
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` (create one with `POST /auth/mcp-token`),
which is accepted on every `/v1` path and on `/api/mcp`. The web UI instead
carries the session cookie that `POST /auth/login` sets.

# Deprecated plugin-specific platform routes (Phase 2, Task 8)
# =============================================================================
#
# Eleven routes that serve one plugin each — the shape CLAUDE.md says must not
# live in src/. The pickers that called them were replaced by the generic
# remote-options mechanism (GET /plugins/{id}/options/{options_id}); this slice
# grepped web/src, web/tests, the bundled plugins and every sibling plugin repo
# and found no live consumer for any of them.
#
# They are marked deprecated rather than deleted because two of them
# (/muni/stops*, /stocks/*) are documented as public API in shipped plugin
# SETUP guides, so a third-party integration this repo cannot see may call
# them. "Deprecation, never deletion" — see
# docs/internal/reference/API_CONVENTIONS.md. Removal is tracked in the issue
# named on each decorator (#1915); until then they keep their exact current contract
# and stay outside the conventions ratchet, because re-shaping a body we
# intend to delete buys a lockstep web change and nothing else.

# ── Deprecation window ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ``deprecated=True`` alone only greys the operation out in Swagger; a caller
# in another repo — the whole reason these were deprecated instead of deleted —
# sees nothing. RFC 8594 / RFC 9745 put the notice on the wire, which is what
# ``docs/internal/reference/API_CONVENTIONS.md`` asks for: ``Deprecation``,
# ``Sunset`` and a ``successor-version`` link.
#
# The date is a quarter out, not "two releases": FiestaBoard cuts a minor
# release every few days, so a release count is not a window an integrator can
# plan against, and two of these routes (``/muni/stops*``, ``/stocks/*``) are
# published as API reference in shipped plugin SETUP guides. A quarter gives
# those plugin authors a release cycle of their own to migrate. Reasoning
# recorded on #1915.
