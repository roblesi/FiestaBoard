# Nearby Aircraft Setup Guide

The Nearby Aircraft feature displays real-time information about aircraft flying within a specified radius of your location. Shows call sign, altitude, ground speed, and squawk code - perfect for aviation enthusiasts, pilots, or anyone curious about what's flying overhead.

## Overview

**What it does:**
- Displays up to 10 nearby aircraft in real-time
- Shows call sign, altitude (feet), ground speed (knots), and squawk code
- Updates automatically based on your refresh interval
- Supports authenticated and unauthenticated API access
- Filters aircraft by distance from your location

**Use Cases:**
- Monitor aircraft traffic near your location
- Track commercial flights overhead
- Educational tool for aviation enthusiasts
- Real-time air traffic awareness

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Coordinates (latitude, longitude) for your location
- ✅ Optional: OpenSky Network account for higher rate limits

## Refresh Interval Guidelines

Choose based on your needs and authentication status:

**Unauthenticated (No API Key):**
- **120 seconds (2 min)**: Default, safe for rate limits
- **300 seconds (5 min)**: Very safe, fewer API calls
- **60 seconds**: Possible but may hit rate limits

**Authenticated (With API Key):**
- **60 seconds (1 min)**: Frequent updates
- **30 seconds**: Very frequent (if needed)
- **120 seconds**: Balanced (recommended)

**Note:** OpenSky rate limits:
- Unauthenticated: 1 request per 10 seconds
- Authenticated: ~10 requests per second

## Radius Selection

Choose radius based on your location and needs:

**Urban Areas (Airports nearby):**
- **25-50 km**: Default, good for most areas
- **10-25 km**: Very local, fewer aircraft
- **50-100 km**: Wider area, more aircraft

**Rural Areas:**
- **50-100 km**: Default, may need larger radius
- **100-200 km**: Very wide area

**Near Major Airports:**
- **10-25 km**: Focus on immediate area
- **25-50 km**: Standard approach/departure paths

## Troubleshooting

### No Aircraft Found

**Problem:** Display shows "NO AIRCRAFT NEARBY"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check radius**: Increase `radius_km` (try 100 km)
2. **Check location**: Verify latitude/longitude are correct
3. **Check time**: Fewer aircraft at night or in remote areas
4. **Check logs**: Look for API errors in container logs
5. **Test API**: Visit [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) to verify coverage

### Rate Limit Errors

**Problem:** "API rate limit exceeded" error

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase refresh interval**: Set `refresh_seconds` to 300+ (5+ minutes)
2. **Get API credentials**: Register for OpenSky account and add client_id/secret
3. **Check cache**: Plugin uses cached data when possible
4. **Wait**: Unauthenticated limit is 1 req/10 sec

### Missing Call Signs

**Problem:** Some aircraft show ICAO addresses instead of call signs

**Solutions:**
1. **Normal behavior**: Not all aircraft broadcast call signs
2. **ICAO address**: Plugin shows 24-bit hex address as fallback
3. **Filtering**: Aircraft without call signs are still included if they have other data

### Altitude/Speed Missing

**Problem:** Some aircraft don't show altitude or speed

**Solutions:**
1. **Data availability**: Not all aircraft broadcast all data
2. **Filtering**: Plugin skips aircraft without required data (altitude, speed)
3. **Coverage**: OpenSky coverage varies by region

### Authentication Not Working

**Problem:** OAuth token errors or authentication failures

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify credentials**: Check client_id and client_secret are correct
2. **Check account**: Ensure OpenSky account is active
3. **Regenerate**: Create new API client in OpenSky account
4. **Fallback**: Plugin works without authentication (lower rate limits)

## Data Source

**OpenSky Network API:**
- **API**: https://opensky-network.org/api
- **Coverage**: Global (varies by region)
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time (updated every few seconds)
- **Rate Limits**: See above
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 client credentials (optional)
- **Documentation**: https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/

**Data Fields:**
- **Call Sign**: Flight identifier (may be null, uses ICAO address as fallback)
- **Altitude**: Geometric (GPS) or barometric altitude in meters (converted to feet)
- **Ground Speed**: Velocity in m/s (converted to knots)
- **Squawk**: Transponder code (4-digit, may be null)

## Advanced Usage

### Combining with Other Features

```

STOCKS: {{stocks.stocks.0.formatted}}
```

### Custom Formatting

```
{center}AIR TRAFFIC
