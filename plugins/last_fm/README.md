**→ [Setup Guide](./docs/SETUP.md)** - API key registration and configuration

## Overview

This plugin fetches the currently playing or most recently played track from a user's Last.fm profile. It works with any music source that scrobbles to Last.fm, including:

- Apple Music (via scrobbler apps)
- Spotify (native Last.fm integration)
- YouTube Music
- Tidal
- And many more

## How It Works

```
Music App → Scrobbler → Last.fm → FiestaBoard → Vestaboard
```

1. You listen to music on your preferred app
2. A scrobbler sends the track info to Last.fm
3. FiestaBoard polls the Last.fm API for your recent tracks
4. The `@attr.nowplaying` flag indicates if you're actively listening
5. Track info is displayed on your Vestaboard

## API Details

This plugin uses the Last.fm `user.getRecentTracks` endpoint:

- **Endpoint**: `http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/`
- **Method**: `user.getRecentTracks`
- **Rate Limits**: ~5 requests/second (we stay well under this)
- **Cost**: FREE

The `@attr.nowplaying` attribute in the response indicates if a track is currently being played, providing true real-time status.

## Troubleshooting

### "User not found" error

- Verify your username is correct (case-sensitive)
- Check your Last.fm profile is public

### "Invalid API key" error

- Regenerate your API key at https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
- Ensure no extra spaces in the key

### Tracks not showing as "now playing"

- Ensure your scrobbler is running and connected
- Some scrobblers have a delay before reporting
- Check that scrobbling is working on your Last.fm profile
